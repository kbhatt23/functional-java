based on JODA time libraries
All the classes are immutable to support functional programming

LocalDate" to handle date only
LocalTime : to habdle time only
LocaldateTime : to handle date and time all togehter

Period calss is used to compare localdate only , it can not compare localtime
Period .getdays method will return month1-month2 only. it wont give difference between the dataes in month
it do not do like isBefore and isAfter and isEqual method of considering all elments combined

Duration class is for localtime only. needs hours, minutes,seconds and nano.do not care about days meonth etc
For localdate parts difference we use Period class
for locatime parts difference we use Duration class
Duration always return logical differences of units

LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime are ways of representing time in user readable formate

Instant is way of these but in machine readable format like old Date API used to store time in millisecond since jan 1 1970(EPOCH)

ZonedDateTime is class which is similar to LocalDateTiem but it also have zone details and zone offset(difference between UTC and currnet zone)
LocalDateTime do not have zoneId attached and offset zone  i.e difference bwteen UTC time and current system default zone time
