spliterator interface is used to create stream from custom data source
for eg: A class holding data from file, or webservice\

Even collection classes implements spliterator interface to create stream from collection

Spliterator will be used by collection and stream will use spilterator to get data from collection

Itnerface have flowoing 4 abstract methods:
 a. boolean tryadvance(consumer) : this is used to do come action if next element is present in stream
 b. Spliterator<T> trySplit: it is used in splitting the data into smaller parts to be used by fork join to run in paraleel
 c. int estimaedZie: size of iteration of foreach
 d. int characterstics: this contains bit of characterstics seperated by | (Or) bitwise operator
 This helps in identifying thebehavious of collections ins stream
 
 eg : sorted, immutable, ordered
 
 This helps inperforamce while calling stream pipeline chain
 eg : set has implmenteation of spliterator containng sorted
 so while calling sorted method in strema pipeline it will be ignored as set is already sorted
  similoiarly arraylist is ordered by default so no need to order the list etc
  This helps in skipping intermediate opertaion and can enhance performance
  
  code example question:
  need to read a file
  each four lines of file represent individual data of book properties like name , genre etc
  We can use spliterator for this
  As we know spliterator tryadvacnce gets called on each iteration of stream
  we can accept a consumer of book taking values from base spliterator of string
  
  This example can be done using class BookUploadData.java using imperative way
  
  Using splerator class name is BookUploadSpliterator.java
